# Burger Builder
Check out the [live app](https://larrycherry-burgerbuilder.herokuapp.com/)

I created this app as a first project exploring react. The live app is hosted on heroku and may take a few seconds to load when starting the web server from a cold start. 

The following are commands for local development
 * npm start (Starts app in production)
 * npm run dev (Starts app in developement)
 * npm run build (Optomizes app for production)

Big Thanks to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for helping lay the foundation for this project.
